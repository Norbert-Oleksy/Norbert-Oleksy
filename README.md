<h3 align="center">Game Developer specializing in Unity (C#) and expanding into Unreal Engine (C++)</h3>

<h5 align="left">Creating immersive and detailed gameplay experiences is what drives me as a game developer.
My passion lies in building systems that not only work flawlessly but also feel intuitive and enjoyable to players.<br><br>
I'm committed to pushing the boundaries of what interactive experiences can offer.
Whether it's prototyping new ideas or optimizing existing features, I aim to create games that are polished, responsive, and meaningful.<br><br>
With several shipped titles on PC and consoles, I’ve been deeply involved in both original development and high-quality ports.
I thrive in cross-functional teams, collaborating closely with designers, artists, and audio engineers to bring complex systems to life.<br><br>
Outside of work, I enjoy building personal prototypes and exploring emerging Unity features.
I often apply what I learn directly into team workflows to boost efficiency or quality.</h5>
